/*  Types of javascript operator:-
(1)Arithmetic Operators
(2)Comparison (Relational) Operators
(3)Bitwise Operators
(4)Logical Operators
(5)Assignment Operators
(6)Special Operators
*/

// (1) Arithmetic operator:- Arithmatic operator are used to perform arthematic operation. there are many types of arithmatic operators they are:-
// (a) addition :- This operator is used to sum two or more values. It is denoted by +
// example:-
                    /*let a=20;
                    let b=40;
                    let sum = a+b;
                    console.log(sum);*/
// (b)subtraction :- This operator is used to subtract two or more values. It is denoted by -
// (c) Multiplication :- This operator is used to multiply two or more values. It is denoted by *
// (d) power :- This operator is used to find power of any values. It is denoted by **
// example
                /*let power=5**2
                console.log(power);*/
// (e) division  :- This operator is used to devide numbers. It is denoted by /
// (f) modulus(reminder)  :- This operator is used to find remainder. It is denoted by %
// (g) incerement :- this is used to iterate the value by 1. it is denoted by ++
// (g) decrement:- this is used to iterate the value by -1. it is denoted by --


// **********(2) Comparison (relational) operator
// The JavaScript comparison operator compares the two operands. The comparison operators are as follows:
/* Operator     	    Description	                                 Example
    ==	                Is equal to	                                10==20 = false
    ===	            Identical (equal and of same type)	            10==20 = false
    !=	                Not equal to	                            10!=20 = true
    !==	                Not Identical	                            20!==20 = false
    >	                Greater than	                            20>10 = true
    >=	                Greater than or equal to	                20>=10 = true
    <	                Less than	                                20<10 = false
    <=	                Less than or equal to	                    20<=10 = false */
